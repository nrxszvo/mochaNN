# Modeling Chaos with Neural Networks

A set of scripts for modeling chaotic dynamical systems using neural networks, built with Pytorch/Lightning.

See [environment.yml](https://github.com/nrxszvo/mochaNN/blob/main/environment.yml) for dependencies.

Currently only the [NHiTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12886) neural architecture is supported. The NHiTS model code is adopted from [Nixtla's neuralforecast repo](https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast), with some minor modifications.

The [dysts](https://github.com/williamgilpin/dysts) repo is used as a reference how to generate datasets for choatic systems.

See [Generic Deep Learning for Chaotic Dyanmics: A Case Study on the Lorenz Attractor](https://nrxszvo.github.io/nhits-lorenz) for an example of a research project that used this repo.
