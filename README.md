# **Mo**deling **Cha**os with **N**eural **N**etworks

A set of scripts for modeling chaotic systems using neural networks, built with Pytorch/Lightning.

Currently only the NHiTS neural architecture is supported. The NHiTS model code is adopted from [Nixtla's neuralforecast repo](https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast), with some minor modifications.

A submodule-friendly fork of the [dysts](https://github.com/williamgilpin/dysts) repo is used for generating datasets of choatic systems.

See [Modeling Chaotic Dyanmics with Deep Learning](https://nrxszvo.github.io/nhits-lorenz) for an example research project that used this repo.
